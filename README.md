#### Description

The biology clinic team consists of members Ahmed Al Hikmani, Iris Yang, Kishan Thambu, and MinGyu Jung who are working along with the Dr. Jorgensen Lab to create a centralized genetic database. 

Many genetic databases including Dr. Jorgensen Lab utilizes google sheets and file maker for data storage and retrieval which is not user-friendly and creates security issues for data backups. 

The proposed system adopts a user-friendly interface, ensuring that researchers, even those with minimal technical proficiency, can input, modify, and retrieve genetic data on DNA/plasmids, alleles, and strains with ease. 

Underlying this interface is a robust database architecture optimized for the specific data storage needs of genetic research that can be accessed via a web server. 

Through the use of database relations technology, our database aims to seamlessly interact with another genetic database named "Worm World", allowing for real-time data import. 

In addition, our database system aims to be compatible for other genetic labs to replace any obsolete software for data storage with a database system that is centralized.
