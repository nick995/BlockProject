Numerous genetic databases including Dr. Jorgensen Lab utilizes google sheets and file maker
for data storage and retrieval which is not user-friendly and creates security issues for data
backups. The proposed system adopts a user-friendly interface, ensuring that researchers, even
those with minimal technical proficiency, can input, modify, and retrieve genetic data on
DNA/plasmids, alleles, and strains with ease. Similar Ideas REDCap Many medical research
labs including University of Utah use the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software
to build and manage online surveys and databases for patientâ€™s medical information. Since they
focus on security and privacy, execution time on the database depends on the size of the
database. If we have a massive amount of data stored in a database, then retrieving the data
will take a while. Using flexible templates incorporate guidelines in maintaining
a laboratory notebook effectively. Their templates are focused on chemistry, material, and
biology experiments which would not be efficient for our sponsor Dr. Jorgensen Lab. Therefore
our proposed system will provide user-friendly templates related to genetics experiments such
as DNA/plasmids, alleles, and strains with ease. LabArchives Harvard LabArchives is a secure
and intuitive cloud-based electronic lab notebook application enabling researchers to easily
create, store, share and manage their research data from computer or mobile device. It is a
flexible and extensible platform that can be easily customized to match each lab's workflow. The
current cost for a professional academic lab is $230 per user per year. And if we want to
customize to fit within the genetics lab, the price increases. Assume there are 5 people in the
lab, the price starts at $1150 per year.
